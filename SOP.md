# Ad Campaign Set Up SOP for Media Platform

## Overview

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the standardized process for setting up advertising campaigns using a former internal media platform. It is intended for trained internal users, media buyers, and agency partners responsible for managing ad campaigns on behalf of clients. Since the platform is no longer operational and I no longer have system access, this documentation has been compiled from memory with the assistance of a former colleague.

## Assets & Requirements Table

Before setting up a campaign, ensure the following are in place:

| Assets & Requirements | Specifications |
| :-------------------- | :------------- |
| Access to the Internal Media Platform | Valid user account, login credentials, necessary permissions to create/manage campaigns |
| Campaign Plan | Defined objectives, target audience, budget, and flight dates |
| Brand Information | Correct legal name, billing details, and any required internal IDs |
| Landing Page URLs | Final, correctly written URLs for all ad destinations |
| UTM Parameters (optional) | Pre-defined tags for traffic source tracking |
| Ad Files | All images and videos meeting ad specifications |
| Tracking Prerequisites | Have been tested by web development team and clearly defined Conversion events |
| Technical Setup | Latest Google Chrome browser installed and any ad blocking software disabled |

Once youâ€™ve met all the requirements, you can proceed to create a new campaign. If you have any issues pertaining to any of these requirements, please contact your Account Manager.

1. Log into the internal media platform using your credentials
