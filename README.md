# Ad-Campaign-Setup

## About
This repository contains internal documentation for setting up advertising campaigns on a now-decommissioned media buying platform. The SOP file provides a detailed, step-by-step guide for launching advertising campaigns on a proprietary internal platform formerly used by a marketing agency. It was reconstructed primarly from memory for reference and archival purposes, and is aimed at former media buyers, internal marketing or media operations teams, and agency partners who used the platform. 

## What to Expect in the SOP
The SOP file provides a detailed, step-by-step guide for launching advertising campaigns on the internal platform. It includes:

   - A checklist of required assets and technical prerequisites
   - Instructions for naming conventions and file prepartion
   - Guidance on platform navigation and campaign setup
   - Details on audience targeitng, budgeting, flight dates, and creative uploads
   - Final review and submission protocols

## Disclaimer
This documentation is a reconstruction based on memory and collaboration (with a former team member). The platformr is no longer live, and this should not be treated as an actionable workflow guidance. All names have been replaced to protect privacy and maintain anonymity.

## Author's Note
This document represents my effort to preserve operational knowledge from a now-defunct internal media platform. The original SOP was co-written by myself and a senior media buyer in 2020 while working at an advertising agency. It was created to standardize campaign setup, minimize errors, and support consistent execution for client accounts.

The successful reconstruction of this SOP demonstrates:
   - Strong  recall of complex technical workflows and platform functionality
   - The ability to synthesize information from memory and external input
   - Commitment to documentation and knowledge preservation
   - Skill in presenting technical processes to a specific, professional audience
